Solid principles are a way, a set of recommendations and principles, to build robust software. SOLID principles work for object-oriented design (OOP). Their author is Robert C. Martin and date from around 2000.

A quick overview
--------------

| Character | Principle Name | Explanation |
|------|----------------|------------|
| `S` | Single responsibility principle | Each class has just one responsibility. |
| `O` | Open/Closed principle | The functionality of a class can be extended without modifying it. |
| `L` | Liskov substitution principle | Classes must be fully substitutable by their descendants. |
| `I` | Interface segregation principle | Use small and narrowly focused interfaces. |
| `D` | Dependency inversion principle | Depend on abstractions, not on implementations. |
