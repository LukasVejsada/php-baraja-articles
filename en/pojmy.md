This is a very brief list of basic concepts that every beginning developer should know. I use them all across articles.

For programmers
--------------------------

- **Program** - an independently running task for a computer.
- **Script** - a series of instructions that are executed by an interpreter (for example, PHP handles a special runtime on a server and JavaScript handles a web browser).
- **Programming language** - the language you use to describe to the computer the instructions it is to execute.
- **Algorithm** - a precise problem-solving procedure for a computer that can be solved in a finite amount of time.
- **Server** - a specially dedicated computer with a constant connection to the internet that provides services to users (for example, providing a website).
- **Demon** - a program that runs in the background of a system and waits for a specific event. When this event occurs, it starts.
- A **smart program** - a well-designed and efficient program. It works fast, without crashes, does not suffer from bugs.
- **Dumb program** - the opposite of a smart program. It's slow, inefficient, jams, crashes, or doesn't work at all.
- **Naive solution** - usually the first idea of how to solve the problem. It is usually very simple and often only works under very specific conditions.
- **Syntax** - describes how to write program code correctly to meet the language standards (sort of like spelling).
- **String** - a sequence of characters, i.e. a group of one or more characters. Typically written in quotation marks.

Related to PHP
--------------------------

- **Code (source)** - the source code of the HTML page. It is a text file that the browser receives from the web server and renders the page graphics according to it. HTML is a coding language.
- **Script** - not a program! Specially written code that is processed by a language interpreter (such as a web browser) and does something based on it.
- **Interpreted language** - the source code does not run directly on the processor, but uses an **interpreter** (such as PHP).
- **Parser (language parser)** - is a program that processes instructions and then executes them.
- **Parser (general)** - a program or script that parses text or code and processes it according to clearly defined rules.
- **Cron** - a script that runs once every certain period of time (usually every day, hour, 30 minutes, ...)
- **Validator** - a program that checks the cleanliness and correctness (validity) of code.
- **Valid code** - is such code that conforms to all code writing standards and does not contain formal errors.

Generally about computers
--------------------------

- **Hardware** - the physical part of a computer. Anything you can kick when something doesn't work.
- **Software** - programs and data. In short, anything that can't be touched.
- **Ping** - network and server response. It's the time it takes for data to get from you to the server and back.
